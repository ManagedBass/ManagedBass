An Alternative to the Bass.Net Managed Wrapper around Un4seen Bass.dll

Bass and its Add-Ons can be downloaded at http://un4seen.com/  
ManagedBass is targeted for Any CPU, but bass dll(s) are separate for x86 and x64. Download the versions you need

Features
-----------------------------------------
* Open Source
* FREE: You get freedom from the licensing of Bass.Net.  
  BASS and other ADDONS STILL NEED TO BE LICENSED.
* You don't have to suppress Popups by providing a Registration Key.
* Method Names have been simplified in Dynamics using `EntryPoint` Parameter of `DllImport`.  
  e.g. Instead of `BassWma.BASS_WMA_EncodeOpenFile()` you could use `BassWma.EncodeOpenFile();`
* Plugin Add-Ons are wrapped in a light-weight way as instances of the Plugin class.  
  Most Plugins are supported.  
  They all were wrapped in just 15 minutes using Plugin class.
* ManagedBass provides completely managed types for your use.  
  It does the Native wrapping in `ManagedBass.Dynamics`.  
  You could use these types in this namespace directly or use Managed Alternatives.
